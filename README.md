A todo list app that i have build with Angular and typescript.
The application contains a login page that uses https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users as a users database.
After you log in, you get into the todos page. it reads todos from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos and you can add more todos by using the Add todo button.
You can also check todo as done, hide all the done todos, remove done todos, decide how many todos will appear on a page and so on.
the app incudes special reactive forms that i have made in order to exercise myself.
